## Project overview

This project is fun application build with react native, it give you possiblity to view all public API on your mobile.
Main goal was depoloy appliation to Google play store. You can find it [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=public.api.list).

Idea behind this app was really simple, we use only two screen list category and result to naviagate over API's. If user find intersting API he has ability to move on API information website. [Expo](https://expo.io/). helps me to develop application faster ;).
