## Project overview

This project is a fun application built with React Native, allowing users to browse various public APIs on their mobile devices. Our main goal was to deploy the application to the Google Play Store, which you can find here.

The idea behind the app is straightforward: it consists of two screens, one listing categories and the other displaying results, enabling users to navigate through different APIs. If a user finds an API interesting, they can access more information about it via the API's website. Expo proved instrumental in accelerating the development process
